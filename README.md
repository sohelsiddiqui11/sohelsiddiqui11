## About Me
I am a Software Developer with a strong focus on backend development, currently improving my skills in **machine learning** and **data visualization**. 🚀

I spend my days:
- Wrangling data with **pandas** and **NumPy** 🐍
- Building ML models with **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow** 🤖
- Practicing DSA on **LeetCode** and **HackerRank** 💻

When I'm not coding, you'll find me in the gym 🏋️‍♂️ or exploring new tech trends. 📚

**Let’s connect and create amazing projects together!** 🌟
